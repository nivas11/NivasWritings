                <h3>&#9734; <span class="story-name">Alberto's new neighbours</span></h3>
                <p class="story">Alberto took one look at his new neighbours and knew that his life was going to get
                    more difficult. There they were, two of them, as big and as noisy as their car – and smelly and
                    stupid as well.Alberto took one look at his new neighbours and knew that his life was going to get
                    more difficult. He watched them arrive in their big, noisy car and watched them get out. There they
                    were, two of them, as big and as noisy as their car – and smelly and stupid as well.
                    'Terrible!' he thought. 'How am I going to put up with them?' He went to tell Mimi. Mimi was the
                    friend he lived with. 'Have you seen the new neighbours?' he asked her.
                    'No,' she said. 'Who are they?'
                    'Two of them. The ones we don’t like. Big and noisy and stupid and smelly. Just like they always
                    are.'
                    'Oh no,' said Mimi. 'How awful! Still, I suppose we can just ignore them.'
                    'I suppose you're right,' agreed Alberto. 'We'll just have to ignore them.'
                    For a few days, then, Alberto and Mimi tried to ignore their new neighbours. When the neighbours
                    went out for a walk, Alberto and Mimi didn't say hello to them. When the neighbours were in their
                    garden, Alberto and Mimi went inside. This was OK for a few days, but, perhaps inevitably, things
                    didn't stay this way …
                    One day, Alberto woke up from his sleep to find one of the neighbours in his garden. 'Mimi!' he
                    shouted. 'Have you seen this!? He's in our garden!!!! Look!'
                    'How terrible,' said Mimi. 'Let's call our staff and make sure they get rid of him immediately!'
                    Mimi went off to call their staff. Two minutes later, Alberto and Mimi's head of staff was out in
                    the garden trying to get rid of the unwelcome neighbour. 'Go on!' he shouted. 'Get out of here! Go
                    home!' The neighbour didn't say anything but gave Alberto and Mimi's head of staff a dirty look,
                    then he went back into his garden. Alberto and Mimi felt better and then asked their head of staff
                    to prepare their lunch for them.
                    However, it wasn't enough. Over the next few days, Alberto and Mimi often found one or other or both
                    of their new neighbours walking around their own garden. It was terrible. To show how they felt,
                    Alberto and Mimi went into their neighbours' garden at night, when the neighbours were inside, and
                    broke all the flowers.
                    The next morning one of the neighbours came to talk to Alberto.
                    'Hey!' he said. 'Hey, you!' Alberto ignored him, but he continued talking. 'You came into our garden
                    last night and broke all the flowers!' Alberto didn't say anything but gave his neighbour a dirty
                    look. 'Now I'm in trouble!' continued his neighbour. 'They think I did it!'
                    'Who are "they"?' asked Alberto.
                    'My owners, of course,' replied the neighbour.
                    'Owners!?' said Alberto. 'You have "owners"?'
                    'Course we do,' said his neighbour. 'Don't you?'
                    'Oh, no,' replied Alberto. 'We have staff.'
                    Alberto went to tell Mimi that the neighbours didn't have staff but owners.
                    'That's not a surprise,' said Mimi. 'That explains everything. That's why they're so noisy and
                    smelly and stupid. We need to make their owners become staff.'
                    The next day, Alberto and Mimi were actually very friendly with their new neighbours. They tried to
                    explain how to make their owners become 'staff'.
                    'Listen,' said Alberto to them. 'It's very easy. First, understand that the house is your house, not
                    theirs.'
                    'And second,' said Mimi, 'make sure that you are always clean.'
                    'Make sure they give you food whenever you want!'
                    'Sit on the newspaper while they are reading it!'
                    'Sleep as much as possible – on their beds!'
                    'And finally, try not to bark but to miaow instead.'
                    But it was no good. The neighbours just didn't understand. After a week, they gave up.
                    'It's no good,' said Mimi. 'They'll never understand – dogs have owners, cats have staff.'</p>

                <h3>&#9734; <span class="story-name">Coming back up</span></h3>
                <p class="story">So we’re driving along, a road in the middle of nowhere, a few trees now and then on
                    each side of the road, mountains in the distance, there hasn’t been a town for ages and then you see
                    this sign, not really a proper sign at all, just a piece of card with some words scribbled on it:
                    ‘Bungee Jumping, 5km’, and an arrow pointing to the left. I can’t even see a road going left, and
                    there’s certainly no sign of any bungee jumping, but you insist, the idea has taken you, you’re
                    crazy about it, you’ve always wanted to do bungee jumping. I know, you think I’m boring because I
                    don’t want to go.

                    ‘Go on!’ you insist. ‘We don’t even have to do the bungee jumping, we can just go there and see
                    what’s happening. It’ll be interesting!’ As usual, you get your way. I give in and off we go along
                    this dirt road, for what seems much more than five kilometres to me. But then, after driving for
                    ages, suddenly, out of nowhere, some trees appear, like a small wood.

                    ‘This must be the place,’ you say. The road narrows into just a path, so we pull over to the side of
                    the road. I couldn’t drive down there if I wanted to. As soon as we’re out of the car we can hear
                    voices: people shouting and laughing. They sound like young people, they sound like they’re having a
                    good time.

                    We slowly walk to where the noise and people are. In the middle of the wood there’s a group of about
                    20 people. The youngest are about 15 or 16, while some of them are perhaps in their late 20s.

                    They look up and see us, then say hello to us. They’re polite, friendly even, but I feel like we’re
                    interrupting a private party – gatecrashing something they’re doing.

                    Once there had been a river running through the middle of the forest, but now there was just a dry
                    ditch. It doesn’t matter; nobody is interested in swimming. A metal bridge crosses the ditch. The
                    bridge doesn’t look too stable. I think the kids had built it themselves. There’s a big group of the
                    kids in the middle of the bridge. They’re all leaning over and looking down into the ditch. They’re
                    all shouting and laughing. Another person is hanging from a long piece of elastic rope in the middle
                    of the ditch. He is laughing like he is mad. The other people slowly pull him up to the bridge. As
                    the guy comes to the top he looks exhilarated and shocked, but also very, very happy.

                    I look at you and can see what you’re thinking.

                    ‘I want to do that!’ you say. I knew it. And you know what I want to say: ‘Danger!!! Damage to
                    internal organs! Safety procedures! Damage to your eyes! The rope can burn you! You can get tangled
                    up in the rope! You can dislocate your arm or your leg! It’s certain that you will get bruises on
                    your arms! What happens if the rope breaks? Who knows who these people are? Have you any idea how
                    far away from a hospital we are?’ I don’t say it, but, yes, you’re right, I am thinking it. I don’t
                    say anything, because I know that you won’t have answers for any of my questions. You know that I’m
                    right, really.

                    You’ve always been a lot more adventurous than me. I know you think I’m boring and safe and always
                    worried about danger and risk.

                    Perhaps you’re right. Perhaps I am too boring.

                    I don’t know why people do it. I really don’t know. I remember when I was a kid, my friend had a
                    bicycle that had no brakes. We used to take his bike without brakes and go down a big hill on it. I
                    think about that, that old bike so many years ago, and I remember how I felt then.

                    I breathe in, close my eyes, don’t think about anything. I jump. I think I’m going forever and
                    wonder when I’ll stop. But it feels great. I feel scared and thrilled and alive. Then there’s a pull
                    and I’m going back up again, and, yes, it is dangerous, but, yes, it is thrilling. But the most
                    exciting, thrilling, wonderful thing of all is seeing your face as I come back up to the bridge.</p>

                <h3>&#9734;	<span class="story-name">Elephants, bananas and Aunty Ethel</span></h3>
                <p class="story">I looked at my watch and saw that it was going backwards. 'That's OK,' I was thinking. 'If my watch is going backwards, then it means that it's early, so I'm not late for work at all.' And then I woke up. Again.So, I was walking along the street on my way to work as usual, but for some reason I was in a hurry. I wasn't really sure why I was in a hurry. And then I realised that I was holding a banana in my hand. I didn't know why I was holding a banana in my hand, but I knew that the banana was really important for some reason. The banana had something to do with the reason that I was late and in a hurry. It was a really important banana, only I didn't know why the banana was so important. Then I met my Aunty Ethel on the street corner. It was strange, because I hadn't seen Aunty Ethel for about twenty years.

                    'Hello!' I said to her. 'I haven't seen you for about twenty years!'
                    
                    I was really surprised to see her, but she didn't seem surprised to see me.
                    
                    'Be careful with that banana!' she said. And I laughed, because I knew that it was a really important banana and, yes, I had to be careful with it. Aunty Ethel decided to walk to work with me, which was a problem because I was late and in a hurry, and she walked really, really slowly. Then, when we went round the corner, there was an elephant blocking the street. It depends where you live, I guess, but in Manchester it's pretty strange to see an elephant blocking the street. The strange thing was, though, that I wasn't really that surprised. 'Oh no!' I was thinking. 'Another elephant blocking the street … what a pain! Especially this morning when I'm late and in a hurry, and with Aunty Ethel, and this really important banana …' Then I started to get really worried, and then … I woke up.
                    
                    I breathed a sigh of relief. 'Thank goodness for that,' I thought. How strange dreams are … I wonder why I was dreaming about elephants and bananas and Aunty Ethel. The radio was already on. The radio comes on automatically at 7 o'clock to wake me up. I looked at the clock. It was already ten past seven. I had to get up quickly. I went into the shower, and I could hear the news on the radio. I couldn't hear it very well, but there was a story on the news about an elephant that had escaped from a local circus. The elephant was causing a lot of trouble walking around the town. I thought this was an incredible coincidence, but then I realised that I had probably heard the news story on the radio when I was half asleep. That was why I was dreaming about an elephant. I quickly got dressed and went into the kitchen to get some coffee before I went to work. I work for a film company. We get ideas for films and film scripts and then we try to produce the films. I thought a film about an elephant in Manchester would be great.
                    
                    There was a note on the kitchen table. It was from my wife. 'Don't forget to buy bananas on your way home from work today!!!' it said. It was a good job she had written the note, because I had completely forgotten about the fact that she has to eat a lot of bananas because of the crazy diet she's on at the moment. I tried to remember to buy bananas on my way home from work and rushed out of the house. As I was walking down the road my mobile rang. It was my mum.
                    
                    'Hello, Mum!' I said. 'What are you ringing at this time for?'
                    
                    'I've got some sad news, I'm afraid, love,' she said. 'Do you remember your Aunty Ethel?'
                    
                    'Just about,' I said. 'But I haven't seen Aunty Ethel for about twenty years.'
                    
                    'Yes, well, she was very old … and I'm afraid she died last night. She'd been very ill … I told you a couple of weeks ago …'
                    
                    'That's sad,' I said.
                    
                    So there I was, walking down the street, late for work, thinking about Aunty Ethel and bananas and elephants, and of course I realised that it was all exactly the same as my dream. And as I started to think more about this, I realised I was walking more and more slowly, and I looked down and saw that the street was turning into hot, wet, sticky toffee, and it was sticking to my shoes, and the quicker I tried to walk, the slower I went. I looked at my watch and saw that my watch was going backwards. 'That's OK,' I was thinking. 'If my watch is going backwards, then it means that it's early and not late, so I'm not late for work at all …' And then I woke up. Again.
                    
                    Now this was strange. This was very, very strange. I got up and pinched myself to make sure I was really awake this time. 'Ouch!' The pinch hurt. This meant I really was awake, and not dreaming this time. It was early. I wasn't late. The radio alarm clock hadn't come on yet. It was only half past six. My wife was still at home.
                    
                    'Have you got enough bananas?' I asked her. She looked at me as if I was crazy.
                    
                    'What do you mean "bananas"?' she asked.
                    
                    'I thought you had to eat lots of bananas for your special diet …'
                    
                    'I have no idea what you're on about!' she said. 'Why? Do you think I need to go on a diet? Do you mean that I'm fat?'
                    
                    'No, no, no … not at all … By the way, have you heard anything about an elephant?'
                    
                    'An elephant?'
                    
                    'Yes, an elephant which has escaped from a circus …'
                    
                    'We live in Manchester. There aren't any circuses in Manchester. And there certainly aren't any elephants. Listen, are you suffering from stress or something? You're working too hard on that new film you're trying to produce, aren't you? Perhaps you should just stay at home today, take it easy …'
                    
                    'Perhaps you're right,' I said. 'I'll just phone my mum.'
                    
                    'Why do you need to phone your mum at half past six in the morning?'
                    
                    'Oh … nothing important,' I said.
                    
                    'Well, I'm off to work. See you later, and take it easy today, OK?'
                    
                    'OK!'
                    
                    I phoned my mum.
                    
                    'Hello, Mum!'
                    
                    'Hello, love. What are you calling this early for?'
                    
                    'Do you remember Aunty Ethel?'
                    
                    'Of course I do … but I haven't seen her for about twenty years or so …'
                    
                    'How is she?'
                    
                    'I've got no idea. Why on earth are you worried about your Aunty Ethel who you haven't seen for twenty years?'
                    
                    'Oh nothing … bye!'
                    
                    I made a cup of tea and went back to bed. Perhaps my wife was right. Perhaps I should just relax and take it easy today. I phoned up my boss.
                    
                    'Listen,' I said, 'I'm not feeling too good today … perhaps too much stress with the production schedule of the new film project …'
                    
                    'That's a shame,' said my boss. 'We've just got a really exciting new idea for a film … I wanted to talk to you about it today. It's a kind of action movie. It's a great story. You have to hear this – an elephant escapes from a circus in a big city and it has eaten some strange, radioactive bananas, so it's going completely crazy. They eventually manage to stop the elephant by covering all the streets with sticky toffee, so that it can't walk!'
                    
                    'I see,' I said. 'And where does my Aunty Ethel come into it?'
                    
                    'Aunty who?'
                    
                    I hung up the phone and hoped that I would wake up. Soon.</p>

                <h3>&#9734;	<span class="story-name">King of the pumpkins</span></h3>
                <p class="story">'Deep in the middle of the woods,' said my mother, 'is the place where the king of the pumpkins lives.' A young boy and his cat try and find out what, if anything, is true about his mother's stories.'Deep in the middle of the woods,' said my mother, 'is the place where the king of the pumpkins lives.'

                    'But pumpkins live in fields, not in forests,' I said to my mother.
                    
                    She wouldn't listen to me. 'I'm telling you,' she said, 'the king of the pumpkins lives in the middle of the woods and the woods that he lives in are the woods right next to our house, the woods you can see out of the window over there.' She pointed with her hand to the woods that were, in fact, just outside the window behind our house. 'He doesn't live in a field like the other pumpkins,' continued mother, 'because he's not an ordinary pumpkin. He's the King Pumpkin.'
                    
                    I shut up and decided to believe her, like you do when you're a kid. Firstly, I knew that it wasn't worth arguing with my mother. She always won. Secondly, when you're a kid, you always believe what grown-ups tell you, no matter how stupid it is. Like Santa Claus and stuff like that. Kids always believe it, even though they know it's stupid.
                    
                    Still, I decided to go and find the king of the pumpkins, partly because I was bored, partly because I was curious, and also – of course – because I wanted to know if my mother really was talking nonsense or not.
                    
                    Mother often talked nonsense, I have to say that. There was the time she told me that the moon was made of cheese. I knew that was nonsense. Then there were all the stories she told me. Stories about frogs, princesses, princes and shoes. Stories about donkeys and unicorns, gnomes and elves, magic mirrors and magic cooking pots. Stories about why the stars are exactly the way they are, why the river that runs through our town has the name that it has, stories about where the sun comes from, why the sky is so far away and why the elephant has a long trunk.
                    
                    Some of these stories, I think, might have been true. I was never sure, and it was difficult to find out. This time, though, with this story about the king of the pumpkins, it was going to be easy to find out if she was telling the truth or not.
                    
                    Some people used to call my mother a witch, but I knew that she wasn't a witch. Just a bit strange perhaps. And she used to talk nonsense. Perhaps it was also because of the black cat we had. People say that witches always have black cats, and we had a black cat. But Mog wasn't a witch's cat. He was just a regular black cat. Mog could talk, though, I have to say that. Perhaps that isn't so regular in a cat, now I think about it.
                    
                    Anyway, I was telling you about the time I went to find the king of the pumpkins. I set off with Mog the cat into the woods to look for the king of the pumpkins. Even though we'd lived in that house near the woods all my life, I had never gone into the middle of the woods. This was the first time. I was glad I had Mog with me. I was a bit scared, even though I didn't really think that the king of the pumpkins lived there.
                    
                    'Watch out for the wolves!' said Mog.
                    
                    'Yes … and the grandmothers too!' I joked.
                    
                    'Let's not leave the path!' said Mog.
                    
                    When people said my mother was a witch, I told them that witches don't have children. 'Yeah,' they replied, 'that's true. But you look more like an elf than a regular kid.' I looked in the mirror to see if I looked like an elf or not. I think I looked like a regular kid, but you never can tell really.
                    
                    'Do you think he's real?' I asked Mog.
                    
                    'Who, the wolf? He certainly is,' replied Mog.
                    
                    'No, not the wolf. I know the wolf is real,' I said to Mog. Sometimes I could hear the wolf howling at night. I knew he was real. 'No, not the wolf. The king of the pumpkins. Do you think he's real?'
                    
                    'Don't know,' said the cat. 'Guess we'll just have to find out.'
                    
                    We walked on into the forest. The trees got taller and taller and taller. The path got narrower and narrower and narrower.
                    
                    'What does he do, then, this king of the pumpkins?' asked Mog.
                    
                    'I don't know really,' I said. 'I guess he just kind of is head pumpkin, boss pumpkin. He decides on pumpkin rules and pumpkin laws, and punishes people who break them.'
                    
                    'Oh, I see,' said Mog. He was quiet for a bit, then said, 'What kind of things are pumpkin rules then?'
                    
                    'Erm, how big you can grow. What colour you have to be. Stuff like that.'
                    
                    'You're making this up, aren't you?' asked Mog.
                    
                    'Yeah,' I said.
                    
                    Eventually, we got to the middle of the forest. At least, I think it was the middle of the forest, but it's difficult to say exactly. There was a clearing, a big space where there were no trees. In the middle of the clearing was the king of the pumpkins.
                    
                    At least, I think it was the king of the pumpkins. It looked like a man at first. He was quite tall and had legs and arms made from sticks. He was wearing an old black coat. His head was a pumpkin. His head was the biggest pumpkin I had ever seen.
                    
                    Me and Mog went up close to him. He didn't say anything.
                    
                    'Is that it?' asked Mog.
                    
                    'I guess so,' I said.
                    
                    'Disappointing,' said Mog.
                    
                    'Do you think he's the real king of the pumpkins?' I asked Mog.
                    
                    'Who knows?' replied the cat.
                    
                    As we walked back along the path out of the forest, I started to think about what was real and what was not. Could things that were made up also be true? What was the difference between 'story' and 'history'? One is real and the other isn't – is that it?
                    
                    'What about all those other things that Mother talks about? Do you think they're real?' I asked Mog.
                    
                    'Hmm … I'm not sure,' said Mog. 'Those stories she tells sometimes … about why the night is black and the day is blue, about golden eggs and girls with golden hair, about why people have ten fingers, ten toes, two feet, two hands and two eyes … Sometimes I think she's crazy, and sometimes I think she might be right …'
                    
                    I knew what Mog meant. I felt the same way. 'Perhaps the stories aren't true,' I said, 'but what they mean is.'</p>

                <h3>&#9734;	<span class="story-name">Mr Smith's new nose</span></h3>
                <p class="story">It is the 22nd century and the world is very different. With new technologies, people can have the bodies that they want. See what happens when Mr Smith decides to change his body. 'Well, Mr Smith, if you prefer a different type of nose, we have a large selection available.'

                    'I think this nose is a bit too small.'
                    
                    'Small noses are very fashionable this year, Mr Smith, very fashionable.'
                    
                    'Do you think it suits me?' asked Mr Smith.
                    
                    'I think it looks very nice,' said the shop assistant.
                    
                    'OK, I'll take it!'
                    
                    On the airbus home, Mr Smith called his wife on his wristphone.
                    
                    'Hello dear! Do you like my new nose?'
                    
                    Mrs Smith looked at her husband's new nose on the videophone monitor on the wall in the kitchen. 'I think it's a bit too small, dear,' she said.
                    
                    'Small noses are very fashionable this year,' replied Mr Smith, 'very fashionable.' It's all so easy now, thought Mr Smith. A hundred years ago, it was impossible to change your body. Or almost impossible – there was the old-fashioned 'plastic surgery', but it was expensive, painful and dangerous. Ugh! Now, thanks to our 22nd-century genetic engineering, we can change our bodies when we want!
                    
                    He looked at his new small nose in the mirror and thought about how fashionable he was. He was very happy with his new nose. The only problem now, he thought, was that he needed some new hair to go with his new nose.
                    
                    He looked on the internet for some new hair, but the internet was so slow. Eventually he decided to go to Bodyco in person.
                    
                    'Good morning, Mr Smith,' said the Bodyco shop assistant. 'How can I help you today?'
                    
                    Mr Smith remembered the robot shop assistant in the Bodyco shop a few years ago. The robot was friendlier and more efficient, but too many robots made too much unemployment and the robot was replaced by a human.
                    
                    'I'd like some new hair, please.'
                    
                    'Certainly, Mr Smith. What type of hair would you like? Short, blond hair goes well with a small nose. How about short, blond hair?'
                    
                    Mr Smith looked at his hair. It was old and grey. Yes, he thought, short and blond. When he was young he had short, blond hair. He wanted to look young again.
                    
                    'Yes, I'll have short blond hair, please. Could it be a bit curly as well?'
                    
                    'Curly?' asked the shop assistant.
                    
                    'Yes, you know, curly – not straight!'
                    
                    'Yes, Mr Smith, I know what "curly" means, but curly hair isn't very fashionable this year.'
                    
                    'Isn't it?'
                    
                    'No, it isn't.'
                    
                    'But I like curly hair!'
                    
                    'Very well, Mr Smith – short, blond, curly hair. Would you like anything else? We have a special offer on ears this week.'
                    
                    'Ears?'
                    
                    'Yes, Mr Smith. The things you hear with.'
                    
                    'I know what ears are! What type of ears are on offer?'
                    
                    Mr Smith went out of the shop with new short, blond, curly hair and two new ears.
                    
                    After this, his interest in his new body started to grow. In the next few weeks he bought new eyes (green – unusual, but fashionable), new hands, new arms, new knees and new feet. Mrs Smith was happy because Mr Smith's new feet didn't smell as bad as his old feet.
                    
                    His body was now completely different.
                    
                    'Am I the same man I was a few weeks ago?' thought Mr Smith. 'I have a new nose, new hair, new ears, new eyes, hands, arms, knees and feet. But I have the same brain – so I think I'm the same man.' He thought he was the same man but he wasn’t sure.
                    
                    One morning, he woke up and his new nose didn't work.
                    
                    'What’s the matter?' asked Mrs Smith.
                    
                    'My new nose doesn't work – it's blocked.'
                    
                    'Maybe you've got a cold,' suggested Mrs Smith.
                    
                    'That’s impossible! This is a genetically engineered Bodyco nose! It doesn't get colds!'
                    
                    But it was true – the new nose did not work. It was blocked and Mr Smith couldn't smell anything.
                    
                    He went back to the Bodyco shop.
                    
                    'Good morning, Mr Smith,' said the assistant. 'What would you like today?'
                    
                    'I want a new nose,' said Mr Smith.
                    
                    'You already want a new nose?' said the surprised shop assistant. 'But you’ve only had this one for a month! Don't worry, small noses are still fashionable!'
                    
                    'No, you don't understand,' said Mr Smith. 'I want a new nose because this one doesn't work!'
                    
                    'That's impossible,' said the shop assistant. 'You have a genetically engineered Bodyco nose. It can't go wrong!'
                    
                    'But it has gone wrong,' replied Mr Smith. 'It's blocked and I can't smell anything.'
                    
                    'What have you used your nose to do, Mr Smith?' asked the shop assistant.
                    
                    'What have I done with my nose? That's a stupid question! I haven't done anything unusual with my nose. I've used it to breathe and to smell, as usual!'
                    
                    'If you have not used your nose correctly, Mr Smith, it is possible that it will not work correctly.'
                    
                    'That's absurd!' shouted Mr Smith. 'I want my money back! I want a refund!'
                    
                    'I'm afraid that we do not give refunds, Mr Smith. There was no guarantee with this nose.'
                    
                    Mr Smith was so angry that he didn't know what to say. He walked out of the shop and didn't say anything.
                    
                    But now he had a big problem: a useless nose. Fashionable, yes. Useful, no.
                    
                    Unfortunately, his problems started to grow. The next morning he woke up and found he couldn't hear anything. Then his new blond hair went grey. Then his new knees didn't move. Then he couldn't see a thing with his unusual green eyes. His fingers fell off, one by one.
                    Eventually, Mrs Smith put him in their aircar and flew to the Bodyco shop. She carried her husband into the shop, because now he couldn't walk.
                    
                    'Good morning, Mr Smith,' said the shop assistant. 'What can I do for you today?'
                    
                    'Mr Smith wouldn’t like anything new at all today, thank you,' replied Mrs Smith. 'But he would like his old body back!'
                    
                    'I'm afraid we don't give refunds, Mrs Smith.'
                    
                    'I don't want a refund,' explained Mrs Smith. 'I want my husband's original body again! I liked it more than this new one!'
                    
                    'I'm afraid that's very difficult, Mrs Smith,' said the shop assistant. 'We are an environmentally friendly company. All our old bodies are recycled.'
                    
                    'But the new body parts that you sold him don't work! What can he do now?'
                    
                    'He could buy a reconditioned body.'
                    
                    'What's a "reconditioned" body?'
                    
                    'It's an old body that has been modified.'
                    
                    'Can I have a look at one?'
                    
                    'Certainly.' The shop assistant spoke to his computer and a reconditioned body appeared. It was a very familiar body. Mrs Smith recognised the big nose and the grey hair.
                    
                    'But that's my husband!' shouted Mrs Smith. 'That's the original Mr Smith!'
                    
                    'Yes, that's right,' said the shop assistant. 'We reconditioned Mr Smith's old body.'
                    
                    'Can he have his old body back then, please?'
                    
                    'Certainly, Mrs Smith. That'll be 100,000 euros, please.'
                    
                    '100,000 euros!' shouted Mrs Smith. 'That's very expensive, isn't it?'
                    
                    'Mr Smith has been reconditioned!'
                    
                    Mr Smith got his own body back, and Mrs Smith flew him back home in the aircar.
                    
                    'I'm myself again!' he shouted.
                    
                    'Not exactly,' said Mrs Smith. 'You have been reconditioned.'
                    
                    'What does "reconditioned" mean?'
                    
                    'Well,' said Mrs Smith, 'I think it means that you have a new brain!'
                    
                    'I think that will be very useful,' said Mr Smith.
                    
                    'I think so too, dear,' said Mrs Smith.</p>

                <h3>&#9734;	<span class="story-name">The broken mirror, the black cat and lots of good luck</span></h3>
                <p class="story">Nikos was an ordinary man. One thing that he did not believe in was superstition. But when so many things that are meant to cause bad luck started bringing him good luck, he began to wonder …Nikos was an ordinary man. Nothing particularly good ever happened to him; nothing particularly bad ever happened to him. He went through life accepting the mixture of good things and bad things that happen to everyone. He never looked for any explanation or reason about why things happened just the way they did.

                    One thing, however, that Nikos absolutely did not believe in was superstition. He had no time for superstition, no time at all. Nikos thought himself to be a very rational man, a man who did not believe that his good luck or bad luck was in any way changed by black cats, walking under ladders, spilling salt or opening umbrellas inside the house.
                    
                    Nikos spent much of his time in the small taverna near where he lived. In the taverna he sat drinking coffee and talking to his friends. Sometimes his friends played dice or cards. Sometimes they played for money. Some of them made bets on horse races or football matches. But Nikos never did. He didn’t know much about sport, so he didn’t think he could predict the winners. And he absolutely didn’t believe in chance or luck or superstition, like a lot of his friends did.
                    
                    One morning Nikos woke up and walked into the bathroom. He started to shave, as he did every morning, but as he was shaving he noticed that the mirror on the bathroom wall wasn’t quite straight. He tried to move it to one side to make it straighter, but as soon as he touched it, the mirror fell off the wall and hit the floor with a huge crash. It broke into a thousand pieces. Nikos knew that some people thought this was unlucky. ‘Seven years’ bad luck,’ they said, when a mirror broke. But Nikos wasn’t superstitious. Nikos wasn’t superstitious at all. He didn’t care. He thought superstition was nonsense. He picked up the pieces of the mirror, put them in the bin and finished shaving without a mirror.
                    
                    After that he went into the kitchen to make himself a sandwich to take to work for his lunch. He cut two pieces of bread and put some cheese on them. Then he thought he needed some salt. When he picked up the salt jar, it fell from his hand and broke on the floor. Salt was everywhere. Some people, he knew, thought that this was also supposed to bring bad luck. But Nikos didn’t care. He didn’t believe in superstitions.
                    
                    He left the house and went to work. On his way to work he saw a black cat running away from him. He didn’t care. He wasn’t superstitious. Some builders were working on a house on his street. There was a ladder across the pavement. Nikos thought about walking around the ladder, but he didn’t care; he wasn’t superstitious and didn’t believe in superstitions, so he walked right underneath the ladder.
                    
                    Even though Nikos wasn’t superstitious, he thought that something bad was certain to happen to him today. He had broken a mirror, spilled some salt, walked under a ladder and seen a black cat running away from him. He told everybody at work what had happened. ‘Something bad will happen to you today!’ they all said. But nothing bad happened to him.
                    
                    That evening, as usual, he went to the taverna. He told all his friends in the taverna that he had broken a mirror, spilled the salt, seen a black cat running away from him and then walked under a ladder. All his friends in the taverna moved away from him. ‘Something bad will happen to him,’ they all said, ‘and we don’t want to be near him when it happens!’
                    
                    But nothing bad happened to Nikos all evening. He sat there as normal, and everything was normal. Nikos was waiting for something bad to happen to him. But it didn’t.
                    
                    ‘Nikos, come and play cards with us!’ joked one of his friends. ‘I’m sure to win!’ Nikos didn’t usually play cards, but tonight he decided to. His friend put a large amount of money on the table. His friend thought Nikos was going to lose. Nikos thought he was going to lose.
                    
                    But it didn’t happen like that.
                    
                    Nikos won. Then he played another game, and he won that one too. Then somebody asked him to play a game of dice, and Nikos won that as well. He won quite a lot of money. ‘Go on then, Nikos,’ his friends shouted, ‘use all the money you have won to buy some lottery tickets!’ Nikos spent all the money he had won on lottery tickets. The draw for the lottery was the next day.
                    
                    The next day after work Nikos went to the taverna again. Everybody was watching the draw for the lottery on TV. The first number came out, for the third prize. It was Nikos’ number. Then the second number, for the second prize. It was another of Nikos’ tickets. Then the first prize. It was Nikos’ number as well. He won all three of the big lottery prizes.
                    
                    It was incredible. It seemed that all the things that people thought caused bad luck actually brought him good luck.
                    
                    The next day Nikos bought a book about superstitions from all over the world. When he had read the book he decided to do everything that would bring him bad luck. He left empty bottles on the table. He asked his wife to cut his hair for him. He accepted a box of knives as a gift. He slept with his feet pointing towards the door. He sat on the corners of tables. He put a candle in front of the mirror. He always left his hat on the bed. He always left his wallet on the bed. He bought things in numbers of six or thirteen. He crossed people on the stairs. He got on a boat and whistled. And with everything he did, he got luckier and luckier. He won the lottery again. He won the games of dice in the taverna every evening. The things got crazier and crazier. He bought a black cat as a pet. He broke a few more mirrors, on purpose. He didn’t look people in the eye when they raised their glasses to him. He put loaves of bread upside down on the table. He spilled salt. He spilled olive oil. He spilled wine.
                    
                    The more superstitious things he did, the luckier he became. He went into the taverna and started to tell all his friends what he thought.
                    
                    ‘You see!’ he told them. ‘I was right all along! Superstition is nonsense! The more things I do to break ridiculous superstitions, the more lucky I am!’
                    
                    ‘But Nikos,’ replied one of his friends, ‘don’t you see that you are actually as superstitious as we are? You are so careful to break superstitions, and this brings you luck. But you are only lucky when you do these things. Your disbelief is actually a kind of belief!’
                    
                    Nikos thought hard about what his friend said. He had to admit that it was true. He was so careful to break all the superstitions he could, that in some way he was actually observing those superstitions.
                    
                    The next day, he stopped spilling salt, chasing away black cats, walking under ladders, putting up umbrellas in the house and breaking mirrors. He also stopped winning money on the lottery. He started to lose at games of cards or dice.
                    
                    He was a normal man again. Sometimes he was lucky, sometimes he wasn’t. He didn’t not believe in superstitions any more, but he didn’t believe in them either.
                    
                    ‘Nikos,’ said his friend to him, ‘it was your belief in yourself that made you lucky. It was your self-confidence that helped you, not superstitions.’
                    
                    Nikos listened to his friend and thought that he was right. But however rational he still believed himself to be, he always wondered what would have happened if he hadn’t broken that mirror …</p>

                <h3>&#9734;	<span class="story-name">The Christmas the lights went out
                </span></h3>
                <p class="story">Five people, whose lives interrelate, live the build-up to Christmas in different ways in different places. A sudden blackout changes their lives forever ...

                    Tom Jankowitz took his coat off and threw it onto the seat in the airport lounge. He sat down and opened up his laptop computer, keeping one eye on the small television which showed the departure times of all the flights from the airport.

                    Tom Jankowitz was tired. Tired and bored. It was Christmas, nearly. Tom hated Christmas. He only remembered that it would be Christmas tomorrow because there were Christmas decorations all over the airport, and he could see the date on the small television showing the departure times of all the flights. '24 December,' it said. 'Happy Christmas' said all the notices in the windows of the shops. The shops were closed now. It was late. Tom was going home. He had been to a business meeting in New York and had to take a plane back home. The meeting had been difficult. He had decided to close a lot of his company's offices. A lot of people were unhappy about his decision, but he didn't care.
                    
                    Tom thought that he would rather spend Christmas on his own in a hotel room with his computer. He didn't really want to go home.
                    
                    Anja Kohonen carefully checked the potatoes roasting in the oven, made sure the wine in the fridge was cold and that there was a bottle of champagne for later. She carefully checked the candles on the Christmas tree, as she didn't want them to set fire to the tree. She looked out of the window. The snow was starting to fall again. She looked at her watch again.
                    
                    Guy Domville finished his beer and walked out of the hot, smoky pub into the cold night air. He thought about getting a taxi home, but knew it would be difficult to find one at this time of the evening, especially on Christmas Eve. Anyway, because it was a clear, crisp night, he thought he would enjoy the walk home. It was late and dark and cold. There weren't many people on the streets. A man came walking towards him. The man was only wearing a T-shirt. He looked like he was freezing cold.
                    
                    'Are you all right?' Guy asked the man.
                    
                    'I'm freezing,' the man replied. Guy took off his coat and gave it to the man.
                    
                    'There you go!' said Guy. The man looked very surprised, but took the coat, put it on and went on his way.
                    
                    'Thanks!' he shouted as he left. Now it was Guy who was freezing. He had no idea why he had just decided to give his coat to a complete stranger. Perhaps because it was nearly Christmas. Perhaps it was because Guy hadn't given presents to anyone else this Christmas. Perhaps it was because this year he had no one to give any presents to.
                    
                    Leila came out of church into the night. It was much colder than she expected. Every other time she had been to stay with her grandmother it had been very hot. She had no idea it could get so cold out here in Damascus, out here on the edge of the desert. That was OK, though. She didn't think that Christmas in a hot place would seem right somehow. Christmas had always been cold for her. She was happy to be here in such a beautiful place, with her mother and her grandmother. It was a shame her father wasn't there, but she hadn't heard from him in months now.
                    
                    Rudolf Lenk was bored. Very bored. It was Christmas Eve and he was stuck in an office, surrounded by computers, completely on his own. Rudolf could think of nothing more boring than this. It was only boredom, thought Rudolf later, that made him do the stupid thing he decided to do.
                    
                    Rudolf Lenk pulled a plug out. It was only a little plug. It wasn't even hard to pull it out. That was all he did. He pulled a small plug out of a small socket. And then.
                    
                    And then.
                    
                    And then.
                    
                    Rudolf Lenk watched the lights go out. At first he watched the lights go out in the office where he was. Then he looked out of the window and watched all the lights go out in the town where he was. And then he imagined what was happening.
                    
                    All
                    across
                    the world,
                    one
                    by
                    one …
                    the lights were going out.
                    
                    Tom Jankowitz hardly noticed as the television screen with the departure times on it flickered, then went off. He looked up just in time to see it before all the lights in the airport went off too. For a few moments there was light coming in from the big window which looked out onto the runway of the airport, but then all the lights on the runway went out as well. Soon, everything was totally, completely and utterly black. The only light came from the tiny little lights on the wings of the aeroplanes and the light from his own portable computer screen. Soon, there was an announcement:
                    
                    'Ladies and gentlemen, we regret to inform you that there seems to have been a power cut. All flights for the moment are cancelled. Thank you.'
                    
                    A man sat down next to Tom.
                    
                    'Looks like we're not going anywhere tonight,' he said. Tom didn't reply, but nodded in agreement. Not going anywhere, he thought. Not going anywhere. I'm not going anywhere. Not tonight, not ever. The only places I ever go are offices of GlobalPower International. He looked at the light coming from his computer screen. Some numbers looked at him. Numbers were the only thing that he was going to see on Christmas Day. Some numbers and his computer. Is that all there is to it? Nothing, thought Tom, is going anywhere.
                    
                    In one second, everything went from light to dark for Anja. Her house, filled with light and warmth and the smells of cooking, went black. The only light and the only warmth came from the big fire that she had started. She looked at the fire which continued burning, filling the room with warm light. It looked good. It made her feel happy. It reminded her of when she was a child. She looked out of the window and saw that it was dark for as far as she could see. The flickering light from the fire illuminated the snowflakes that were now falling heavily outside. She wondered if anyone was coming to join her this evening.
                    
                    It was completely quiet on the streets outside. Guy thought it was strange. Usually these streets were full of busy people. Now they were completely empty. The snow that had fallen looked like a carpet. Outside looked like inside. Walking home, lost in his thoughts and the snow, Guy hardly noticed that all the streetlights had gone out. The darkness around him was the same as the darkness he felt inside him.
                    
                    Sometimes he could see into the windows of the houses that he passed. Most of the houses were dark, but some people had lit candles. The candles looked beautiful, he thought. They made the people's houses look warm and friendly and cosy.
                    
                    Guy felt sad that he was now going back to a house where no one had lit any candles. He didn't want to go home. His flat was empty. It would be the first Christmas without his daughter and his ex-wife. He thought about how hot it would be where they were and wondered what Christmas would be like for them. He hadn't spoken to his daughter in over three months.
                    
                    Guy didn't want to go home. He thought about how his wife always said he worked too much, that he never took time to do the simple things in life. Now here he was, walking along the streets where he usually went to work, doing nothing. He decided that he would leave his job with GlobalPower in January. He wanted to walk these strange empty streets forever. Or at least until he could see his daughter again.
                    
                    Leila looked up at the night sky so full of stars. She thought she had never seen so many stars in the sky when she lived in London. The city was so dark, it made it easier to see the sky. She walked with her mother along the narrow streets of the Christian quarter of old Damascus, all decorated for Christmas and lit now with candles. She was happy here with her mother and grandmother, but she still missed her father, even though he hadn't called.
                    
                    Rudolf Lenk realised what he had done with a shock. He put the plug back in its socket. He hoped nobody would have noticed what he had done.
                    
                    And
                    Very
                    Very
                    Slowly
                    One. By. One.
                    The lights
                    across the world.
                    Came back on again.
                    
                    Like a breath at first, like a tiny whisper which nobody could hear, which grew and grew and grew, like the first ripple out in the sea which will become a gigantic wave, like the spark which lights a candle which can start a fire, like the first falling snowflake of a giant storm, like the first star which appears in the night sky and makes enough light for you to be able to see another, and then another, and another and more and more until the whole sky which covers the whole world is hung with starry, illuminated fruit, light connected to light until at midnight, the darkest point of the night, the whole world was full of bright, bright light.
                    
                    Tom Jankowitz watched the lights going back on again in the airport and heard the sound of people cheering. He cheered as well and smiled at the man who was sitting next to him. He felt like someone had turned a light on in him too. He was looking forward to being home. 'I'm going somewhere,' he thought. 'I've got somewhere to go.'
                    
                    Anja got up and turned the lights that had come on off again. 'I like the dark,' she thought to herself. 'I like the dark and the fire, just like this. That's how I like it.' She curled up next to the fire and fell asleep.
                    
                    Guy was looking for a tiny piece of paper he remembered having put in his pocket months ago. It was so dark out here that he couldn't see anything. His hands were so cold that it was difficult to find anything in his pockets.
                    
                    Then, suddenly, everything became light. He realised that he was standing under a streetlight that had just come on again. He found the tiny piece of paper in his wallet with a long number written on it. The number had faded, but he could still read it. He found some one pound coins in his other pocket. He found a phone box, but the phone didn't work. He walked some more until he found another phone box. He picked up the telephone receiver and heard the bleeping sound. It worked. He put the money in and began to dial the number.
                    
                    Back at home in their flat with her mother and her grandmother and all the other Syrian branch of her Anglo-Arabic family, Leila heard the old phone ringing. Who would be calling at this time of night? She ran across the room to answer it.
                    
                    Rudolf Lenk was writing a note on a piece of paper. He addressed the note to his boss at GlobalPower International and left it on his desk. 'Yes, it was me,' he wrote. 'And no, I don't want my job any more. Oh, and by the way, happy Christmas!'                </p>

                <p class="story">Fausto Ruiz got off the boat at the port of the city where he had been born fifty years ago, and to which he had not returned for twenty years.Fausto Ruiz got off the boat at the port of the city where he had been born fifty years ago, and to which he had not returned for twenty years. He walked along the seafront, surprised by how much his hometown had changed, and also by how much of it he could still recognise. There were lots of new buildings up on the hills around the city now, buildings which he didn’t recognise. Yet many of the old buildings along the sea were exactly the same as he remembered them, although many of the old shops he remembered were there no more.

                    He walked away from the port and into the centre of the city. He walked up the main road and saw how all the shops had changed, but that there was still one small café there which was the same as it had been when he was young and famous. He walked into the café and sat down at one of the tables. He recognised the owner of the café behind the bar as well as the waiter who was working there. They both looked much, much older. Fausto felt certain that he didn’t look as old as they did, even though they were all twenty years older now.
                    
                    Fausto sat at his table and waited for the waiter to come to him. He sat there for ten, fifteen, twenty minutes. Half an hour passed and the waiter continued to ignore him. Fausto raised his arm and shouted to the waiter, then to the owner of the café behind the bar, but it was useless. They didn’t come and ask him what he wanted. They were ignoring him.
                    
                    Angry, Fausto got up and walked out of the café, slamming the door behind him. Such ignorant people, he thought. Now I remember why I left this town twenty years ago and why I never came back.
                    
                    He walked along the main street as far as the main square in the town and when he arrived at the main square he remembered the other reason why he had never come back. In the main square of the town there was the theatre. As he looked at the theatre, Fausto Ruiz had a terrible memory of what had happened there twenty years ago.
                    
                    Twenty years ago, Fausto Ruiz had been the most famous singer in the world. He had sung in all of the most famous opera houses in the world. He had sung in London, New York, Moscow, Buenos Aires, Tokyo and Sydney. Everywhere he went, people paid large sums of money for tickets, then when they saw him sing they clapped and applauded and cheered for hours. When he was at the height of his fame, Fausto Ruiz decided to come back to his home town and to sing in a triumphant concert in the theatre on the main square of the town.
                    
                    The concert was announced and all the tickets sold out within a few hours. The evening of the concert, thousands of people crowded into the theatre to see the legendary Fausto Ruiz sing in the theatre of his hometown.
                    
                    There was silence as Fausto walked onto the stage. Then he began to sing one of his best-known songs. And at the end of the song, there was just silence. Nobody clapped, nobody applauded, nobody cheered. Fausto waited, very surprised for a moment, then started to sing another song. At the end of this song, there was silence for a moment, then the people began to boo and to hiss. Fausto tried to cover the noise of the booing and hissing by singing another song, very loudly this time. But it got worse. The louder he sang, the louder the boos and hisses became. Then someone threw a tomato at him. Then someone else threw a rotten orange at him. Then someone else threw an old shoe at him. Soon, there was a rain of rotten fruit and vegetables and smelly old shoes falling down on the great Fausto Ruiz. Fausto was angry. Fausto was furious. He stormed off the stage and out of the theatre. He left his hometown that night, and he said that he would never, ever go back there ever again.
                    
                    But twenty years later, Fausto Ruiz changed his mind. He was getting old now, he thought, and he wanted to go back home again, to see the town where he had grown up. But in the café, he realised that perhaps not much had really changed. He decided to walk into the theatre. As he walked in he saw the man selling tickets in the box office. It was the same man from twenty years ago. Fausto said hello to him but the man said nothing and ignored him. ‘Still the same,’ thought Fausto. He walked into the theatre and got up onto the empty stage. He thought he could hear the terrible booing and hissing of that night twenty years ago.
                    
                    He felt sad, and left the theatre and decided to go and visit the house where he had been born fifty years ago. He walked all the way across the town, expecting to be recognised by people. When he got close to his old house he walked through the park where he had played as a small child. He saw some men there, the same age as he was, and thought that he remembered them. They were people who had been his friends when he was at school. He walked over to them to say hello, but they too ignored him. He walked past the old shops near his house. They hadn’t changed. There were still the same people there, all of whom ignored him.
                    
                    He was so angry and so disappointed now that he began to shout as he walked along the streets. ‘I am the great Fausto Ruiz!!! The greatest singer the world has ever heard!!!’ Nobody took any notice of him. He continued, ‘Don’t you know me??? Don’t you recognise me???’ Nobody took any notice.
                    
                    When he finally reached his old house he at least had a pleasant surprise. Outside the house, there was a statue, and it was a statue of himself. ‘Finally!’ thought Fausto. ‘Somebody has recognised my genius! They put up a statue of me ... and they never even told me!’
                    
                    Fausto went to have a closer look at the statue. There was some writing at the bottom of the statue. ‘Fausto Ruiz,’ it said, ‘Singer’. Fausto was disappointed that it said only ‘singer’ and not ‘the greatest singer in the world’, but at least it was a statue. There was some more writing. He looked carefully at it. There was his date of birth, fifty years ago. And then there was something else. It was the date of his death. And the date was yesterday.</p>

                <h3>&#9734;	<span class="story-name">The fix</span></h3>
                <p class="story">The four judges must agree on who will win the four awards in the important Global Music Awards. But there is a problem. They must all agree on each winner. If they can’t all agree, nobody will win.The four judges have been sitting in a small room in the Milton Hotel in London for three hours now. The judges must agree on who will win the four awards in the important Global Music Awards: Best Album, Best Song, Best New Band and Lifetime Achievement Award. Outside the small room where the judges are, five hundred people are sitting waiting. They are all very excited and they are all very nervous. They want to know who is going to win the important awards. The television show goes live in 30 minutes. Excitement is growing; tension is rising.

                    But there is a problem. A big problem. The judges have not yet agreed on one single thing.
                    
                    The judges must all agree on each winner. If they can’t all agree, then the award will not be given – nobody will win.
                    
                    The four judges are David Froth, the music critic for an important newspaper, Betty Weill, the head of a big record company, Jake Dangerous, a singer who won the award for best song last year and Dan Snaith. Dan Snaith isn’t an important person. Dan Snaith is a reader of New Music Weekly, a music magazine. He won a competition in the magazine to be one of the judges of the Global Music Awards.
                    
                    ‘OK, guys, come on ... we have to decide now,’ says David Froth. ‘We can’t wait any more. Best Album – I vote for the Polar Gorillas’ first album. Their punk-influenced sound and intelligent lyrics make them the best band around.’
                    
                    ‘I agree,’ says Betty Weill. ‘But they’re all very young – we can give them the Best New Band award, then we can give the Best Album award to Janie Waller. Her album, Smooth As Chocolate, is a great jazz–pop crossover.’
                    
                    ‘It’s already sold a million copies,’ says Jake Dangerous.
                    
                    ‘Exactly!’ says Betty.
                    
                    ‘No!’ says Jake. ‘It’s already sold a million copies, so she doesn’t need an award! The Best Album should go to Missy Queen. Her album Girlz is the best hip hop record in years.’
                    
                    ‘Hmm ... it’s certainly an impressive record,’ says David Froth, ‘but I think there’s only one really great track on it – the song “Hey! You! Listen Up!”’
                    
                    ‘We can give her Best Song then!’ says Jake.
                    
                    ‘OK, now we’re getting somewhere. We’re finally making progress,’ says David Froth. ‘What about Lifetime Achievement? Remember, this is a really important award. It’s recognition for a singer who has changed the course of popular music!’
                    
                    ‘I think Jake Dangerous should win,’ says Jake Dangerous. Nobody listens to him.
                    
                    ‘Dan – what do you think?’ asks David Froth.
                    
                    Dan says nothing. He was very excited about being a judge for the Global Music Awards, but now he is disappointed. Dan knows that David Froth wants the Polar Gorillas to win because he was the first person to write about them – he ‘discovered’ them, and so when they become very famous, Froth will take the credit. Betty Weill wants Janie Waller to win because Janie Waller releases records for her record company. If Janie Waller wins, her record will sell even more copies and Betty Weill will become even richer. Jake Dangerous wants Missy Queen to win because Missy Queen is his girlfriend. Dan is disappointed because now he knows that the Global Music Awards are, in fact, a fix.
                    
                    ‘Look, our time is up!’ says Froth. ‘Can we agree on this: Best Album, Janie Waller; Best Song, Missy Queen; Best New Band, Polar Gorillas? Lifetime Achievement ... OK, Dan, we’ll leave this up to you. But remember – Dylan Roberts is in the audience tonight, so is Jack Michaelson, and Nobbo from X5. I don’t have to tell you that Dylan Roberts is the voice of a generation, Jack Michaelson is very, very rich, and Nobbo from X5 is bringing peace to the world. He’s also a friend of the Secretary General of the United Nations. The choice is yours!’
                    
                    The judges walk out onto the stage in the Milton Hotel. Five hundred excited, nervous people are watching them. Five hundred cameras flash when they go on stage. Dan feels very scared. He also knows that millions of people around the world are watching on TV.
                    
                    The judges all stand up on the stage and pretend to open envelopes.
                    
                    ‘And the winner is ...,’ they all say. There is a moment of silence then lots and lots of really loud applause as the judges read out the names of their friends.
                    
                    Then it is Dan’s turn.
                    
                    ‘OK, everyone,’ says David Froth. ‘Are we having a good time?!’ Everyone shouts and claps. ‘Finally, we arrive at perhaps the most important award this evening: the Lifetime Achievement Award. Who will win this year? Will it be Dylan Roberts, voice of a generation? Or Jack Michaelson? Erm ... dancer of a generation. Or Nobbo, bringer of world peace? To present the award, here is Dan Snaith, winner of the New Music Weekly competition.’ Five hundred people applaud and shout. Five hundred cameras flash again in Dan’s face. Millions of people are watching him on TV.
                    
                    Dan gets up nervously and stands in front of the microphone.
                    
                    ‘Good evening!’ he says. He opens an envelope which has a piece of paper in it. Nothing is written on the piece of paper. He says the words, ‘... and the winner is ...’ He stops and pauses. There is total silence in the room.
                    
                    ‘The winner is ... you!’
                    
                    There is more total silence in the room. A few people say, ‘What???’
                    
                    ‘That’s right!’ continues Dan, feeling more confident now. ‘You!’ He looks directly into the TV cameras. ‘All the people around the world who listen to music and play music and love music! You are the most important people!’
                    
                    There is the sound of surprise in the big room. Dan sees Dylan Roberts, Jack Michaelson and Nobbo leave the room.
                    
                    ‘These awards,’ Dan continues, ‘are a fix! The music business is a fix! If nobody listened to or bought the music, there would be no winners here tonight. That is why YOU are the winners!’
                    
                    Some people cheer and applaud, some people say, ‘Boooo!’
                    
                    But tonight, Dan Snaith knows that he has won too.</p>

                <h3>&#9734;	<span class="story-name">The golden boys</span></h3>
                <p class="story">Mr and Mrs Hamilton had two sons, Richard and Philip, who were both taller and friendlier than me. My parents liked them a lot. ‘Why can’t you be more like Richard and Philip?’ I hated them.Every August. Every August for twelve years. Every August for twelve years we went to the same small town on holiday. Every August for twelve years we went to the same beach. Every August for twelve years my parents rented the same small house in the same small town near the same beach, so every morning of every August for twelve years I woke up and walked down to the same beach and sat under the same umbrella or on the same towel in front of the same sea.

                    There was a small café on the beach where we sat every day, and every day Mr Morelli in the café said ‘Good morning!’ to my parents, and then always patted me on the head like a dog. Every day we walked down to our red and white umbrella. Every day my father sat on his deckchair and read the newspaper then went to sleep. Every day my mother went for a swim in the sea and then went to sleep. Every lunchtime we ate the same cheese sandwiches which my mother made, and then every afternoon we went up to the café and ate an ice cream while my parents talked to Mr Morelli about the weather. Every summer for twelve years I sat there and read books and sometimes played volleyball with some of the other boys and girls who were there, but I never made any friends.
                    
                    It was so boring.
                    
                    Every August for twelve years the same family sat next to us. They were called the Hamiltons. We had a red and white umbrella, they had a green one. Every morning my parents said ‘Good morning!’ to Mr and Mrs Hamilton, and Mr and Mrs Hamilton said ‘Good morning!’ to my parents. Sometimes they talked about the weather.
                    
                    Mr and Mrs Hamilton had two sons. Richard was the same age as me, and his brother Philip was two years older than me. Richard and Philip were both taller than me. Richard and Philip were very friendly and both very handsome. They were much friendlier and more handsome than me. They made friends with everyone and organised the games of volleyball on the beach or swimming races in the sea with the other children. They always won the games of volleyball and the swimming races. My parents liked Richard and Philip a lot. ‘Why can’t you be more like Richard and Philip?’ they said to me. ‘Look at them! They make friends with everyone! They are polite, good boys! You just sit here reading books and doing nothing!’
                    
                    I, of course, hated them.
                    
                    Richard and Philip, Richard and Philip, Richard and Philip – it was all I ever heard from my parents every August for twelve years. Richard and Philip were perfect. Everything about them was better than anything about me. Even their green beach umbrella was better than our red and white one.
                    
                    I was sixteen years old the last summer we went there. Perfect Richard and perfect Philip came to the beach one day and said that they were going to have a barbecue at lunchtime. They were going to cook for everyone! ‘Forget your cheese sandwiches,’ they laughed. ‘Come and have some hamburgers or barbecue chicken with us! We’re going to cook!’
                    
                    My parents, of course, thought this was wonderful. ‘Look at how good Richard and Philip are! They’re going to do a barbecue and they’ve invited everybody! You couldn’t organise a barbecue!’
                    
                    Every summer for twelve years, on the other side of my family, sat Mrs Moffat. Mrs Moffat was a very large woman who came to the same beach every summer for twelve years on her own. Nobody knew if she had a husband or a family, but my parents said that she was very rich. Mrs Moffat always came to the beach wearing a large hat, a pair of sunglasses and a gold necklace. She always carried a big bag with her. She never went swimming, but sat under her umbrella reading magazines until lunchtime when she went home.
                    
                    Richard and Philip, of course, also invited Mrs Moffat to their barbecue.
                    
                    Richard and Philip’s barbecue was, of course, a great success. About twenty people came, and Richard and Philip cooked lots of hamburgers and chicken and made a big salad and brought big pieces of watermelon and everyone laughed and joked and told Mr and Mrs Hamilton how wonderful their sons were. I ate one hamburger and didn’t talk to anybody. After a while, I left, and made sure that nobody saw me leave.
                    
                    Mrs Moffat ate three plates of chicken and two hamburgers. After that she said she was very tired and was going to go and have a sleep. She walked over to her umbrella and sat down on her deckchair and went to sleep. When she woke up later, everybody on the beach was surprised to hear her screaming and shouting.
                    
                    ‘My bag!!!! My bag!!!’ she shouted. ‘It’s gone!!! It’s GONE!!!’ Everybody on the beach ran over to Mrs Moffat to see what the problem was. ‘Someone has taken my bag!!!’ she screamed. ‘Someone has stolen my bag!!!’
                    
                    ‘Impossible!’ said everybody else. ‘This is a very safe, friendly beach! There are no thieves here!’ But it was true. Mrs Moffat’s big bag wasn’t there any more.
                    
                    Nobody had seen any strangers on the beach during the barbecue, so they thought that Mrs Moffat had perhaps taken her bag somewhere and forgotten it. Mr Morelli from the café organised a search of the beach. Everybody looked everywhere for Mrs Moffat’s big bag.
                    
                    Eventually, they found it. My father saw it hidden in the sand under a deckchair. A green deckchair. Richard and Philip’s deckchair. My father took it and gave it back to Mrs Moffat. Everybody looked at Richard and Philip. Richard and Philip, the golden boys, stood there looking surprised. Of course, they didn’t know what to say.
                    
                    Mrs Moffat looked in her bag. She started screaming again. Her purse with her money in it wasn’t in the big bag. ‘My purse!’ she shouted, ‘My purse has gone! Those boys have stolen it! They organised a barbecue so they could steal my purse!’
                    
                    Everybody tried to explain to Mrs Moffat that this couldn’t possibly be true, but Mrs Moffat called the police. The police arrived and asked golden Richard and golden Philip lots of questions. Richard and Philip couldn’t answer the questions. Eventually, they all got into a police car and drove away to the police station.
                    
                    I sat there, pretending to read my book and trying to hide a big, fat purse under the sand on the beach.
                    
                    That was the last summer we went to the beach. My parents never talked about Richard and Philip again.</p>
